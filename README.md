Tip percentages, payment types, and night/day revenue distribution

 Goals:

Improve cab dispatch and routing efficiency

Guide pricing strategies based on trip dynamics

Support strategic cab positioning across NYC

 Includes:

Jupyter Notebook with full analysis & visualizations

Final Word report with business insights and recommendations

Supporting plots and exported figures
